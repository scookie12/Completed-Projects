Simulated Annealing

This program takes in an input text document with parameters for 
grid size, number of vertices, and edges between vertices, and then
outputs a file with vertices placement on the grid for the least amount
of edges the program could find based on simulated annealing. 

To build the program, navigate to the source code directory, and run 
the following command to create an exe file: 

gcc Place.c -o Place.exe

Then, run the newly created executable with an input file and output file. 
Such as the folling command, reading input.txt and writting to output.txt

./Place input.txt output.txt
